			<h2> Nana Manga</h2>
			<p> Nana (ナナ), often stylized as NANA, is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Ai Yazawa.The manga was published in Shueisha's manga magazine Cookie.[2] Viz Media licensed the series 	for release in North America and published it in their Shojo Beat magazine.[3] Nana was put on hiatus in August 2009, when Yazawa suddenly fell ill. <br><br>
			In 2005, Nana was adapted into a live-action film starring Mika Nakashima and Aoi Miyazaki.[5] Nakashima returned to star in the 2006 sequel, while Yui Ichikawa replaced Miyazaki.[6] That same year, an anime based on the manga was produced by Madhouse Studios.[7][8] It aired for forty-seven episodes. <br><br>
			The story follows Nana Komatsu and Nana Osaki, who meet coincidentally on a train to Tokyo. They become roommates and develop a close friendship.</p>

			    <h2>Nana Osaki</h2>
			    <p>Nana Osaki is the main character with Hachi. She is the vocalist of the band Black Stones, also known as Blast. Though Nana may look like a tough punk rocker, she has a kind heart and is a devoted friend. However, she can be possessive and dark, easily becoming emotional to the extent where she has trouble breathing.</p>

			    <h2>Hachi aka Nana Komatsu</h2>
			    <p>Nana Komatsu comes to Tokyo looking to find her dream, though she initially comes in order to stay in a relationship with her boyfriend, Shouji Endou. Unlike Osaki, however, she comes from a large and happy household, though her childish outlook prevents her from living on her own at first and she is prone to falling in love easily.</p>

			    <h2>Nobuo Terashima</h2>
			    <p>He is the guitarist of Blast and was the only person able to befriend Nana Oosaki during high school—which coincidentally began their shared love for punk music. He is friendly and optimistic, but at times, he tends to miss the focus of conversations around him. Before Nana's "smoking ban", he is the only non-smoking member of Blast.</p>
